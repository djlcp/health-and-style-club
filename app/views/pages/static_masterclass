<h1> The Monthly Masterclass</h1>
<br>
<p>
Each month there will be an exciting new masterclass released on a
new health & fitness, styling or personal development related topic.
The masterclasses are comprised of a welcome video introducing that month's contributor,
5-6 videos, and a workbook to help you delve deeper into the topic.
<br>
All of the previous masterclasses will be stored in the masterclass library to
view whenever you like.
<br>
Our very first masterclass is all about Yoga. There are six short yoga routines
of varying difficulty, and a workbook all about how you can incorporate
yoga into your daily routine no matter how busy your lifestyle.
<br>
Some topics which will be covered in upcoming masterclasses are:
<ul>
<li>Self-Care for Busy Women</li>
<li>How to Recognise the Signs of Anxiety & Depression and What To Do About It</li>
<li>Holistic Nutrition</li>
<li>How to Create Your Dream Life</li>
<li>Kicking Sugar</li>
<li>And much more...</li>
